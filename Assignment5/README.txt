
The data file contains 1600 samples of observations from four conditions in a 2AFC experiment. Data is arranged in three columns, denoting respectively condition number, participant choice (0 = left, 1 = right) and response time in seconds. The four conditions can be interpreted as (1) strong motion to the left, (2) weak motion to the left, (3) weak motion to the right and (4) strong motion to the right. 

A good DDM fit would recover the drift rates, thresholds and non-decision time for each of the four conditions. Since the experiment was a 2AFC perceptual decision-making experiment, we expect a priori that the differences in responses across the conditions will be mostly located in the drift rates, and not affect the other parameters. 

Your submission should contain the code and a text file listing the parameters estimated for all four conditions separately.
